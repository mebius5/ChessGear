# Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 2

**Evaluator: [Hari Menon](mailto:hmenon@cs.jhu.edu)**


Overall you have done a nice job on Iteration-1; the project is quite an interesting one as well. Keep up the momentum for the next iterations!

## Feedback

I have discussed most of this with you already. But here are some comments on your submission.

### Use Cases, Domain Model, Gui Sketches

In general you have done a good job on the use cases. There are some relations between use cases that you probably should indicate explicitly. For example, Step 7 of "User uploads game" segways in to "System Analyzes Moves". That sort of thing should be explicitly indicated.

A domain model would be useful for your project. Many people who looked at your submission had a bit of trouble understanding the terms-of-art and what is involved in this system.

The GUI sketches are generally fine, but could do with a bit of explanation. For example, I did not realize until I talked to you that the engine's analysis was indicated as a column in the move list. Similarly the way you were displaying the move "tree" was unclear to me until we talked.

*(-2 Points)*

### Suggestions

* As I mentioned when we talked, it may be more useful to display the engine's analysis in detail instead of just the numeric score. For example, displaying what the engine thinks is the current best line would be pretty useful. The point is that if you are bothering to integrate an engine, you may as well make the most of it.

* A minor one: Consider allowing bulk upload of PGNs. This shouldn't be too hard to implement and had be pretty useful for testing.

**Grade: 98/100**
