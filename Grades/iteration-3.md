# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 2

**Evaluator: [Hari Menon](mailto:hmenon@cs.jhu.edu)**


Overall your project appears to be coming along nicely. Good work!

You have a good initial set of tests going. Keep that up as you add functionality to your application. For front-end testing, Angular provides its own unit testing framework; so that should be helpful as you start building your front-end this coming iteration.

For the next iteration try to ensure that you have Travis integration working. You can get some bonus points for it and you already have a chunk of tests that can be run with Maven.

It may also be worth considering using feature branches in Git for your development. It can be useful to avoid stepping on people's toes as you get closer to the full application.
