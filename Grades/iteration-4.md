# Iteration 4 Evaluation - Group 2

**Evaluator: Hari Menon (mailto:hmenon@cs.jhu.edu)**

## Git

You are making good use of Github (even great use compared to many other groups!). However some of your issues definitely need some descriptive text. Many are simply filenames; though the commits associated with it gives some idea about the intent, that is not really how things should be. *-3 Points*

## Running project

The project builds and there are a chunk of tests for the backend as well. So you are doing reasonably on that front.

While I did get it to build, it wasn't entirely obvious how Stockfish would integrate with your application without actually looking at the code in `Engine`; you have specific expectations of where your code is being run from. It will be useful to add some "unified" build and integration instructions for someone who wants to build both stockfish and your application and use them together. *-1 Point*


## Iteration Plan

The plan looks fine. 

Hopefully you will have made progress on the front-end by iteration-5. Given that your backend is in reasonable shape, that should be a primary concern.

## Testing

Good. I haven't checked coverage on the tests yet; but we will do that for the final iteration at least. So ensure that your tests are kept up to date.

Have you considered your test plans for the front-end as yet?

Did you manage to get Travis-CI integration working or are you still having issues? I can't see the result on your page.

## Overall:

Your codebase looks good. I will try to take a more indepth code review of sorts for the next iteration.

The main thing to do at this point is to focus on the front-end and the integration. 

**Grade: 96/100**
