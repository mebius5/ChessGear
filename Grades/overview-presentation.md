OOSE Project Overview Presentation Evaluation
---------------------------------------------

**Group: 2**

* Background/Purpose: clearly explained and understandable?

You did a good job here. But remember that your audience may only have a limited understanding of chess, and even less about chess prepartion and helper software. So you may want to tune your introductory parts a bit.

* Architecture explained? General structure of code at this point explained?

Once again you did a good job here. It may be worth starting out with a higher level diagram of your whole application and drilling down in to (important) parts (including relevant/interesting bits of code).

* Presentation organization, both in terms of logistics and quality of slides, properly taking turns, demo going smoothly, etc.

Once again a good job here!
